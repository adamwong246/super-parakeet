# testeranto
## a manifesto

"testeranto" ( a pun based on the language "esperanto") is a bespoke Typescript testing framework. Inspired by cucumber feature files, it is a way of specifing stateful logic. Testeranto is NOT for testing pure functions- is designed only to address only _stateful_ logic. At the moment, there are 3 type interfaces:

- testeranto<redux>
- testeranto<redux-toolkit> (redux store + reselect selectors)
- testeranto<react> (react-test-renderer)

but there exists many more possibilities!

- testeranto<http>
- testeranto<web3>
- testeranto<YOUR DB HERE>
